<h1>Contributing to Breathe<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-to-breathe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There are four main ways you might consider contributing to Breathe.</p>
<div class="section" id="give-it-a-go">
<h2>Give It A Go<a class="headerlink" href="#give-it-a-go" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>...and let me know!</strong> Firstly, the more people using it the better, but more
than that, hearing about the project being put to use is a great motivator for
the developer, namely me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-bugs-suggest-features">
<h2>Report Bugs &amp; Suggest Features<a class="headerlink" href="#report-bugs-suggest-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Embarrassingly I don&#8217;t get to use Breathe that much in my general work, so it
doesn&#8217;t really get pushed beyond the test code we have here in the repository.</p>
<p>If you use it and find issues with it, minor or major, please let me know and if
possible provide some detail so I can reproduce it.</p>
<p>With the help of those who have posted issues on the github issue tracker we&#8217;ve
managed to track down and improve some of the less obvious (and some more
obvious!) parts of Breathe that weren&#8217;t working properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improve-the-documentation">
<h2>Improve the Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#improve-the-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve made an effort to document Breathe so it is usable, but I have a twisted
perspective on the whole thing as I made it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already had some help with the documentation, which was greatly
appreciated, but if you managed to get it working and find that the
documentation could have been clearer in parts, let me know or write up a
paragraph or two that would have helped you when you were trying it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fork-it-and-improve-the-code">
<h2>Fork It! And Improve the Code<a class="headerlink" href="#fork-it-and-improve-the-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you find a bug, quite like Python and have some time, then grab a copy of the
code and have a go at fixing it. Nothing motivates me quite like other people
caring enough to put a bit of time into working on it. The contributions we&#8217;ve
had this way have been great and much appreciated.</p>
<p>If you want to help out, take a look at the <a class="reference internal" href="codeguide.html#codeguide"><em>code guide</em></a> to see how
it is all structured and works.</p>
